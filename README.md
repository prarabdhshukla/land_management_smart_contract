# Solidity Contract for Land Record Management


This Solidity contract is designed for managing land records and transactions in a decentralized manner. It includes data structures and functions for managing ownership, sale, and access permissions for different parties involved in land transactions.

## Data Structures
---------------

The contract includes the following data structures:

-   `Land`: Represents a land record with an ID, location, owner address, price, and sale status.
-   `GovernmentAuthority`: Represents a government authority with an officer address and access permission status.
-   `LegalProfessional`: Represents a legal professional with a lawyer address and access permission status.
-   `RealEstateAgent`: Represents a real estate agent with an agent address and access permission status.
-   `Surveyor`: Represents a surveyor with a surveyor address and access permission status.
-   `Notary`: Represents a notary with a notary address and access permission status.

The data structures are stored in separate mappings, which can be accessed by their respective addresses or IDs.

## Workflow
--------

The workflow of the contract is as follows:

1.  Landowners can register their land records by calling the `registerLand` function, providing the land ID, location, and price.
2.  Landowners can set their land for sale or take it off the market by calling the `setLandForSale` function, providing the land ID and sale status.
3.  Government authorities, legal professionals, real estate agents, surveyors, and notaries can be added or removed from the contract by calling their respective functions, which require access permission.
4.  Government authorities can update the price of a land record by calling the `updateLandPrice` function, providing the land ID and new price.
5.  Legal professionals can add or remove legal documents related to a land transaction, which are not included in this contract.
6.  Real estate agents can buy and sell land records by calling the `buyLand` function, providing the land ID and the correct price in Ether. The buyer must have enough Ether in their wallet to complete the transaction.
7.  Surveyors can resolve boundary disputes by calling the `resolveBoundaryDispute` function, providing the land ID and the new location.
8.  Notaries can validate and certify land transactions, which are not included in this contract.
9.  Real estate agents can transfer ownership of land records by calling the `transferOwnership` function, providing the land ID and the buyer address. The land must not be already for sale, and the buyer must negotiate terms and attend closing before the ownership transfer is completed.

## Access Permissions
------------------

Access to different functions in the contract is restricted by the `onlyAuthorized` modifier, which requires that the caller is one of the following:

-   A government authority with access permission.
-   A legal professional with access permission.
-   A real estate agent with access permission.
-   A surveyor with access permission.
-   A notary with access permission.

The access permissions can be granted or revoked by government authorities using their respective functions.

## Conclusion
----------

This Solidity contract provides a basic framework for managing land records and transactions in a decentralized and transparent manner. It can be extended and customized to meet specific requirements and regulations for land management in different jurisdictions.
